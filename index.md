## Background

BicycLED animates cyclists which correspond to the number of bikes currently parked outside of this window on a low-resolution LED “screen”.

It consists of sewed mosquito netting holding
20 rows of 58 addressable LEDs which are 
controlled by an ESP-32 microcontroller.

The mesh structure can be adapted to a curved surface with ease, while its light weight allows for easy and non-disruptive installation and disassembly.

Using a low-resolution format has a two-fold purpose: it draws the viewer in through requiring a great level of focus to discern the content of the animation, while allowing for less resources to be used (in terms of both electricity and computing power) than a higher resolution animation would require.

In sewing a display for a digital artwork, this work explores the potential power of combining analogue crafts with digital technology and of the intrinsic reward of learning new skills in an unfamiliar domain.

I hope to encourage others to contribute ideas for how they would iterate on this piece to provide useful information for cyclists and an aesthetically rewarding viewing for other passersby.
